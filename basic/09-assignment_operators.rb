# Operators available

# Equal operator (=)
# Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
# x = 10

# Add AND operator (+=)
# Adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand
# x = 2 and y = 3
# x += y => x = 5

# Subtract AND operator (-=)
# Subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand
# x = 5 and y = 2
# x -= y => x = 3

# Multiply AND operator (*=)
# Multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand
# x = 2 and y = 2
# x *= y => x = 4

# Divide AND operator (/=)
# Divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand
# x = 6 and y = 2
# x /= y => x = 3

# Modulus AND operator (%=)
# Takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand
# x = 10 and y = 3
# x %= y => x = 1

# Exponent AND operator (**=)
# Performs exponential calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand
# x = 2 and y = 3
# x **= y => x = 8
